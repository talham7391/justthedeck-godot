# Just The Deck

The idea behind this project was to enable people to play any card game they want over WIFI. The service this app interfaces with: https://github.com/talham7391/justthedeck-service

# Features

To allow people to play any game they want, the app should allow them to create/join games and giving them a deck of cards. Players can then perform actions on those cards such as:

* Select cards.
* Place card(s) in hand.
* Place card(s) on table (face up or face down).
* Shuffle & distribute cards.

With these operations, people can play any game they want. They essentially have a virtual deck of cards.
